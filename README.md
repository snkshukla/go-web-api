## Golang basic web app

This application does very little and is meant for only testing purposes:

1. It allows you to reach it with any path, i.e. accepts all paths
2. It logs the request it received and the headers in the request
3. It sends a 200 response for all requests and sends the request url and the headers back in the json response(body)
